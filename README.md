What is it ?
-----

X-flash is my Sega Megadrive developpement cartridge.
I use it for some research and do all of my hardware test.
It's based on the good old EPM240 and a 64Mb flash memory

Product Feature :
-----

    Rewritable 64 Mb Flash ROM
    192 Macrocells CPLD
    Clean 5V <> 3.3V level shifting
    7 GPIO for user
    Open Source Hardware & Software & PCB

Cartridge supported :
-----
    Classic 32Mb cartridge ( no mapper )
    
    
How to use it :
-----

Just flash the needed core into the CPLD and cartridge will works in the same way as an original.
You can reflash memory with any compatible Megadrive reader ( for exemple MD Dumper / Krikkz / Sanni cart Reader )
